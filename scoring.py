"""
Turning two numbers into one, and one number into something a person can read.
← YOU BUILD THIS IN MILESTONES 4 AND 5

Two functions live here, and both are stubs.

`combine_signals` is where your false-positive decision from Milestone 1
actually gets made. Everything above it — the labels, the appeal path — is
downstream of a number this function produced.

`score_to_label` is where you stop writing for a machine and start writing for
a person. A score of 0.62 means nothing to a writer.

⚠️ Your README's **Signals and Scoring** section has to name the file and
function holding your combining rule. The grader checks your code against what
you claim, so that line should read `scoring.py::combine_signals`.
"""

import config


def combine_signals(model_score: float, style_score: float) -> float:
    """
    Combine two 0-1 signals into one 0-1 score. Higher means more likely AI.

    The rule: the AI end has to be earned by BOTH signals. The signal that reads
    more human counts for `WEIGHT_MORE_HUMAN_SIGNAL` (0.75) and the one that
    reads more AI for the remaining 0.25:

        combined = 0.75 * min(model, style) + 0.25 * max(model, style)

    When the signals agree this is their shared value. When they split, the
    result is pulled toward the human reading, so a single signal at 0.9 with
    the other at 0.1 lands at 0.30 rather than 0.50. That is the false-positive
    decision from Milestone 1: some AI text will slip through as "unsure" so
    that fewer real writers are accused.

    What it cannot fix: a writer both signals misread. Plain, even prose scores
    high on both, so there is no disagreement to lean on.

    low, high = sorted((model_score, style_score))

def score_to_label(score: float) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Turn a score into a guess and the text a reader actually sees.
    ← TODO (Milestone 5)

    Returns:
        (guess, label_text) — where `guess` is a short machine-readable string
        like "ai" / "human" / "unsure", and `label_text` is the full sentence
        shown to a person.

    ⚠️ Write the label text for someone who has never heard the word
    "threshold".

        ✗ "human, 0.81 confidence"
        ✓ "We think this was probably written by a person."

    All three labels have to be **reachable**. If no score can produce one of
    them, your ranges have a gap — and Milestone 5 asks you to submit text that
    produces each one, which is how you'd find out.

    The hardest one to write is "unsure". It has to admit uncertainty without
    sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
    written every word themselves. Your breakout asks your group what they'd
    think if they got it on their own work. That question is the whole
    milestone.
